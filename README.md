# Survey-Display
The purpose of this application is to call the SurveyMonkey API in order to obtain and console log the results of a survey. This script found in index.js currently uses hard-coded URLs. If the end goal was to write production level code, I would re-write the script to be scalable by using string interpolation to form the URL's allowing various survey Id's to be used seemlessly.
